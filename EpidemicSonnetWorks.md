# Epidemic Sonnet Works

To coincide with the release of [*Mathematics of Epidemics on Networks*](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047) and to take advantage of the alternate interpretation of the title, *Epidemic Sonnet Works*, we are collecting poetry about epidemic modeling.

For a chance to win a free copy of the book, please [email us](mailto:epidemicsonnetworks@gmail.com) a sonnet, limerick, or other poem with a theme related to epidemic modeling by **May 31 2017**.

## Why are we doing this?
- For fun.
- To publicize our [book](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047) which should come out around the end of May.
- To publicize our software package [EoN](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks) (Epidemics on Networks) which provides efficient simulation algorithms and solves many of the commonly used ODE models for disease spread in networks.


## Our attempt

(summarizes chapters 1-6)

*When partnerships endure so long that to*  
*Disease they are like frozen ties that bind,*  
*Mass action fails us till new paradigms*  
*Emerge; and networks then are useful tools.*


*Equation counts are exponential till*  
*Reduced --- through automorphic symmetries*  
*Or caref'ly cutting out some vertices.*  
*But yet complexity is too high still.*


*And so our mod'ler must approximate*  
*And close equations --- but not too simply.*  
*For she must doubly count a high degree.*  
*Or, she may watch diseases percolate.*


*With these techniques our mod'ler has new keys*  
*To learn how partnerships affect disease.*

### The fine print:

- Create a poem with an epidemic modeling theme.
- Email it to [epidemicsonnetworks@gmail.com](mailto:epidemicsonnetworks@gmail.com).
- If you're randomly selected, you get a free copy of the book (if you're not randomly selected, you can [buy it](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047)).
