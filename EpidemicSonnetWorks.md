To coincide with the release of [*Mathematics of Epidemics on Networks*](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047) and to take advantage of the alternate interpretation of the title, Epidemic Sonnet Works, we are collecting poetry about epidemic modeling.

For a chance to win a free copy of the book, please [email us](mailto:epidemicsonnetworks@gmail.com) a sonnet, limerick, or other poem with a theme related to epidemic modeling by *May 31 2017*.
