## Chapter 1 

## Chapter 2 

- In Proposition 2.4, in equations for k=1,...,N-1, the value Y_2^0 should be interpreted as the same as Y^0 and Y_1^{N}  should be interpreted as the same as Y^N.

## Chapter 3

## Chapter 4

 - In Figure 4.7c: \tau is actually 1.1\tau_c, not 1.2\tau_c

 - In Figure 4.11: \tau is not 2\tau_c.  It is actually 1.5 \tau_c = 1.5 \gamma/ \<K\>  (the factor of
2 should be 1.5)

## Chapter 5 

## Chapter 6 

- In Figure 6.7, it was not made clear that the percolation is performed on a single network for each N, and all edges are given a weight uniformly in (0,1) and kept only if the weight is less than p.  The edge weights are kept constant as p changes.

- equation 6.8a, \xi should be \zeta.

- displayed equation for example 6.3 \xi should be \zeta
