  "body": "### Epidemics on Networks\r\nThe software provided on this site is based on the forthcoming book **Mathematics of network epidemics: from exact to approximate models** by Kiss, Miller, and Simon.  At present it contains a nearly complete collection of Python code for simulating the spread of SIS and SIR disease in networks.  It relies on the NetworkX package.\r\n\r\nAs we develop this further, we plan to include other languages.  We also hope to add code which solves the differential equation systems developed in the book.\r\n",
